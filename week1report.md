### Week 1 Report: Minesweeper AI Project
# Date: January 16, 2025
# Approximate Hours Spent: 6 hours

#What have you done this week?
This week, I started the initial phase of the Minesweeper AI project. I focused on setting up and outlining the project’s structure. This involved selecting Python as the primary programming language and familiarizing myself with the basic mechanics of Minesweeper to ensure I fully understand the game before starting the AI implementation. I also reviewed different AI algorithms that could be used for this project, including logical inference and probabilistic reasoning. I began researching Minesweeper AI approaches, with a particular focus on algorithms like constraint satisfaction and probabilistic reasoning.

# How has the project progressed?
The project has made good initial progress. The main focus this week was on understanding the game mechanics, setting up the board, and deciding on the structure for implementing the AI. I also mapped out a rough plan for how the AI should make decisions based on the game state (using logic to deduce safe tiles).

What did you learn this week/today?
This week, I learned about the various strategies employed for AI in Minesweeper games. I came across probabilistic reasoning methods, which could be useful in situations where the AI is uncertain. This understanding will help in crafting an efficient decision-making process for the AI. I learned about setting up Python for AI-based projects.

# What has been unclear or problematic?
The most challenging aspect this week was deciding which AI algorithms would be most efficient for Minesweeper, particularly when it comes to handling the probabilistic aspects of the game. The overlap between logic and probability requires careful balancing, and I’m still deciding  which approach will provide the best performance. Another challenge is ensuring that the AI remains efficient when applied to complex mine distributions.

# What next?
For next week, I plan to implement the basic logical inference mechanism where the AI can deduce safe tiles based on the revealed numbers. I also plan to create the game in python using the java code as a reference. After making the AI, I will probably test and evaluate the basic AI decision-making loop to ensure that it’s making correct moves.

# Questions:
What AI algorithms would be challenging enough and best for minesweeper?
